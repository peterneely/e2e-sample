==========

Sample automation tests using Ruby, Cucumber and the PageObject gem -- among others.

Start at features/checkout_guest.feature, then find the step definitions in features/step_definitions.

The page object pattern is demonstrated in features/support/pages.

Other gem usage (for abstracting sample data and environment configurations) can be seen under the config folder.
